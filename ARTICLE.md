## ["The Tools of a Blind Programmer"](https://www.parhamdoustdar.com/2016/04/03/tools-of-blind-programmer/)

The article I picked for this assignment is "The Tools of a Blind Programmer". I chose to write about this article as it presents a completely different view on software engineering, specifically it shows how a blind software engineer goes by his work and what challenges he needs to overcome. His main tool is the screen reader which he uses to read the screen, control the mouse, hierarchically view the contents on the screen, inspect different types of elements on web pages, etc. The author also talks about the programming languages, IDEs and OSs he uses in his everyday life. Additionally, he mentions the productivity tools he tries to use, which heavily use visualization, and how he overocomes the challenges of understanding those visualizations. 
It is interesting to see how a blind programmer carves their own path and uses the same technology that everyone else uses, but with his own methods. Understanding how he operates with no visual cues can even be helpful to programmers that can see, as often he would try to find the most straightforward shortcuts.

What I found particularly fascinating is how Doustdar's experience illustrates the broader limitations of accessibility in software and operating systems. For one, he explains why, with its command environment, Linux isn't web-browser accessible in a format similar to Windows. His criticism of productivity software such as Google Analytics and Trello, in regards to an improper compatibility with a screen reader, reflects gaps in accessible design. Not only is the article a tribute to determination, but it is a reflection of a demand for even more accessability in technology. It is a powerful reminder of technology's role in overcoming gaps and opening doors for all.
